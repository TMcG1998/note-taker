  ## Usage
  
  Upon landing on the website, the user will see a basic landing page with a 'Get Started' button. After clicking it, they will be brought to the actual note-taking page. In the left column the user can see their existing notes, and can click on them to edit an existing note, or click the trash icon to delete an existing note. To create a new note, the user would first click the '+' symbol in the top left, and then after filling out the note information, click the save icon in the top right.
